# Cumulocity thin-edge.io Management UI

hello

This project adds an configuration ui to thin-edge.io. It enables you to use thin-edge.io with an easy-to-use docker based deployment and no code commissioning process. This helps to setup and monitor the edge using a web-ui:
* web-ui, for easy setup of the thin edge 
* simple line chart to view streamed data and to view historical data
* component to store measurements locally in a mongo db

# Solution components

This solution consists of 3 services:
* `tedge`: contain the thin edge core services: `tedge-agent`, `tedge-mapper`, ... and `tedge-ui` app
* `mqtt-collector`: listens to measurements on all topics of the mosquitto broker and sends them to the mongo db
* `mongodb`: stores the measurements in a collection, to be retrieved by the web-ui. All measurements have time-to-live (TTL) of 300. This can be changed

The following diagram show how the components (`tedge-ui`, `node` backend, `tedge` processes) in the tedge service communicate:

# Build thin edge binaries and run solution

To build the docker image the docker memory config must be set greater than 2GB, e.g. 4GB.
To build the docker solution run:
```
docker-compose up
```

# Configure thin edge in the web-ui

To access the web-ui open a web browser at: http://localhost:9080/#/setup.\
Here you start the setup of the edge and enter external device id and your cumulocity tenant url.\
![Setup](resource/01-Setup.png)
Then press configure to create a device certificate. This Will late be uploaded to you cloud tenant. The thin edge uses the certificate for authentication:
![Setup](resource/02-Setup.png)
This will generate a certificate. This has to be uploaded through the web-ui. As mentioned before, the certificate is uploaded to the cloud tenant.
![Setup](resource/03-Setup.png)
Alternatively, you can download the certificate locally and upload it manually to your cloud tenant.
![Setup](resource/05-Setup.png)
A detailed description how to import your certificate can de found is [Cumulocity Administration Documentation](https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/device-management/#managing-trusted-certificates) to your cumulocity cloud tenant.\
Download the certificate.\
When the certificate is uploaded you can start the edge. If everything went well the completion of the startup is acknowledged
![Setup](resource/01-Control.png)

The edge processes are started and the thin edge is registered in the cloud tenant
![Setup](resource/01-Cloud.png)

The registration to the cloud can be verified here as well:
![Setup](resource/04-Setup.png)

Then you can access the analytics dashboard : http://localhost:9080/#/analytics

and change the settings of the chart:
